"""
In programming, whitespace refers to any nonprinting character, such as
spaces, tabs, and end-of-
line
symbols. You can use whitespace to organize
your output so itâ€™s easier for users to read.
To add a tab to your text, use the character combination \t as shown:
"""
# print("Python")
# # Use \t to print with 4 spases intendations
# print("\tPuthon")

""""
To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \n:
"""
# print("Laguages: \nPython \nJava")

# # "\n\t" tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab.
# print("Language: \n\tPython \n\tJava \n\tC")
